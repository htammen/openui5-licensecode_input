TITLE=OpenUI5 licensecode_input

demo.description=<h1>LicenseCode Demo</h1><p>Here you see three examples of the LicenseCode UI5 control.</br>Enter some values and press the <strong>Save</strong> button to see validation errors</p><p>The input of a value is splitted into several, configurable input fields but the value property of the control contains the combined input of all single controls. This value is displayed behind the Label 'LicenseCode value'.</p><p>This example uses a simple self developed solution to validate the values display them. In a real world example I recommend usage of the <strong>openui5-validator</strong> control developed by Mauricio Lauffer.</p>
